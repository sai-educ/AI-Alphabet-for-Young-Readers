                <h2><strong>Our Mission</strong></h2>
                <p>In an age where artificial intelligence is becoming increasingly prevalent in our daily lives, it's crucial that children develop AI literacy from an early age. Our goal is to help young learners understand that "technology is a helper, not a human" and to provide them with the vocabulary and concepts they need to navigate the digital world safely and confidently.</p>

                <h2><strong>Our Inspiration</strong></h2>
                <p>This resource is based on a growing recognition that children need to begin developing AI literacy early. With tech companies offering AI tools to children under 13, it's more important than ever to teach youngsters about these technologies in an age-appropriate way.</p>
                <p>The AI Alphabet helps children recognize and understand the new vocabularies that are increasingly part of the emerging age of AI in schools and society.</p>
